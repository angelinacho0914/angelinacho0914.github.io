##### Abstract

Sigmund Freud’s *Civilization and Its Discontents* explores the intricate relationship between civilization and individual suffering, emphasizing the roles of pleasure, unpleasure, and sensibility. This paper focuses on Chapter Two of the text, where Freud introduces the pleasure and reality principles as mechanisms that govern human happiness and suffering. Freud highlights three methods—powerful deflections, substitutive satisfactions, and intoxicating substances—that alter our sensibility toward misery and examines their varying efficacy in mitigating distress. He argues that sensation underpins all suffering and asserts that the absence or alteration of sensation could render misery nonexistent. Furthermore, Freud investigates the fleeting nature of happiness, linking it to intense, momentary sensations such as sexual love and the spontaneous enjoyment of beauty. This analysis delves into how sensibility impacts our perception of pleasure and pain, offering insights into human behavior and proposing ways to navigate the inevitable suffering imposed by civilization. Ultimately, Freud’s work underscores the complex interplay between societal structures and the human psyche, suggesting that altering our sensibility might reshape our experience of both joy and despair.
