## Introduction

Analytics is the science of iterative exploration of data that can be used to gain insight and optimize business processes. Data visualization and predictive analytics techniques are used to investigate the relationships between items of interest to improve the understanding of complex managerial models with sometimes large data sets to aid decision-making. These techniques and methods are introduced with widely used commercial software packages for data mining and predictive analytics, in the context of real-world applications from diverse business areas such as marketing, finance, and operations. Students will gain exposure to R, a popular open-source package used by analytics practitioners around the world. Topics covered include advanced methods for data visualization, logistic regression, decision tree learning methods, clustering, and association rules. Case studies draw on examples ranging from database marketing to financial forecasting.

## Paper 1: Campus Recruitment - Academic and Employability Factors Influencing Placement

In this case, we will explore a dataset from “Campus Recruitment - Academic and Employability Factors Influencing Placement” provided by Ben Roshan in Business Analytics at Jain University in Bangalore.

## Paper 2: Real of Fake News

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not news is fake or real based on the text characteristics/attributes in the text. This type of prediction is known in analytics as classification. There are numerous techniques and models for classification, and the project will explore some of these techniques.

## Paper 3: Black Friday

A retailers' goal is to attract customers for Black Friday deals, which has become a competition among retailers to get the customers to their online platforms or physical retail stores. Data science techniques help retailers with proper insight into this goal using historical data and Association Rules. The project is divided into two main parts: exploring the Black Friday data, and using Association Rules to find possible associations between purchases. The idea is to try to get consumers who purchase one product/service (Antecedent) to also purchase another (Consequent).
